        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I have been programming for around six years. I have a pretty solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and am learning javascript as you read this (neat!). In addition to the standard web langauges, I have a couple years experience programming in the ever-so-cumbersome, but necessary, Java language. Finally, I have about a
        year experience in both C++ and C#, with a very quick and dirty overview of SQL. Overall, my current strengths are more on the front-end/web-design side, but that's changing rapidly, so stay tuned. </p>

        <h3>Federal Service</h3>
        <p>What does this have to do with web development? Directly - probably nothing. Indirectly - soft skills. I worked for three years in federal service where I learned the irreplacable value of clear written and oral communication, research, time management, organization, customer service, teamwork, and self-worth.
        I am a firm believer that even if you are the best at something, you will not make it far without the soft skills to back it up. I have always taken pride in my ability to meet deadlines, stay organized when under a multitude of projects,
        provide the most professional customer service even when circumstances are not favorable for one or more parties, be that team-player who is accountable, responsible, and helpful, and knowing that my actions are meaningful while also understanding my limitations.
        With me, you are always getting the full package.</p>

      <h2>My Education</h2>
      <div class="education-row">
          <img class="ua-image" src="Images/UA Circle.png" alt="UA Photo">
        <h3>University of Arizona</h3>
        <p>I graduated Summa Cum Laude (4.0 GPA) with a Bachelors of Science (BS) from The University of Arizona in 2019. I double majored into Criminal Justice Studies and Public Policy and Management. My coursework focused on critical analysis, research, and group projects that were based on
        criminology, criminal theory, public policy creation and implementation, management theories, organizational design and theory, and local and international business relationships. As a bonus, a couple Spanish classes were thrown into my cirriculum, so I know basic Spanish - which is sweet.
        My favorite memories are the ones where my study group would spend hours on end in a room way too small for the size of our group. Aside from the many many shenanigans, those study groups were always the most helpful. Personal achievement: I completed three years of coursework in two years.</p>

        <h3>Pima Community College</h3>
        <p>I began college at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona simply due to how cheap it was. I graduated in 2017 with an Associates of Applied Science in Science with a concentration in Computer Science (whew!). Outside of general studies, my focal courses included
        programming logic, Java programming, C++ programming, data structures, and information technology. I was a member of the prestigious Phi Theta Kappa organization (which I recommend for any community college student, if given the opportunity).
        My favorite memory of my time at Pima Community College was being able to participate in an Honors Colloquium course where I worked in a small group for the entire semester to research, present information to the local community, and help fight/prevent online digital piracy - a truly fascinating topic with no clear-cut solution.</p>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

        <img class="controller-image" src="Images/game-console.png" alt="Controller Photo">
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>Video games are by and far my favorite hobby. I have been playing games since I was a wee lad, starting the with SNES. For me, video games help take my mind off of work, provide a way to communicate with friends (thanks Covid-19), and just 'relax'. I will play
        just about any and all game genres from Minecraft, to Call of Duty, to Dota2, to the Elder Scrolls, an so on. In the recent years, my love for single-player campaigns have been taken over by competitive team-based games (are you seeing the 'teamwork' theme, yet?). My insatiable competitive spirit
        keeps dragging me back to the games where as a solo player winning is almost impossible, and thus, teamwork is necessary to win. Just like in the professional world, clear communication, teamwork, and personal effort is required to be the best.</p>

          <img class="target-image" src="Images/target circle.png" alt="Target Photo">
        <h3>Target Shooting</h3>
        <p>Safety first. Safety always. When the opportunity presents itself, I am always trying to get out into the desert to set up some targets and have a good time. I enjoy target shooting because I beleive the skills learned from this hobby can translate into the other parts of my life.
          For example, it teaches me to concentrate on myself and on my target or goal, awareness of both what I am doing and what others are doing around me, and responsiblity for myself, my actions, and for the care and maintenance of my equipment. I also enjoy taking friends who are unfamiliar
          with firearms out to target shoot. I usually provide a one on one teaching session on how a firearm works, the different types, the proper way to handle a firearm, and the four safety rules of shooting. Of course, taking a professionally license gun safety course will always be better than what I can provide, but
          I believe at least knowing the fundamentals of how to safely handle such a controversial item, is better than no knowledge, at all.</p>
